# Image-search-engine
The image search engine is a simple yet functional app that demonstrates how to integrate Unsplash's API with web technologies. Users can enter a keyword (e.g., "mountains," "cats") into a search bar, and the app fetches images related to that keyword from Unsplash, then displays them dynamically on the page.
